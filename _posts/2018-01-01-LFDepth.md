We propose to analyse the spatial occlusion relationships of 3D objects based on local contextual information orgaized as SuperPixels. Depth estimation for challenging intricate areas can be obviously improved compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### Abstract
> Depth estimation is a fundamental problem for light field photography applications. Numerous methods have been proposed in recent years, which either focus on crafting cost terms for more robust matching, or on analyzing the geometry of scene structures embedded in the epipolar-plane images. Significant improvements have been made in terms of overall depth estimation error; however, current state-of-the-art methods still show limitations in handling intricate occluding structures and complex scenes with multiple occlusions. To address these challenging issues, we propose a very effective depth estimation framework which focuses on regularizing the initial label confidence map and edge strength weights. Specifically, we first detect partially occluded boundary regions (POBR) via superpixel
based regularization. Series of shrinkage/reinforcement operations are then applied on the label confidence map and edge strength weights over the POBR. We show that after weight manipulations, even a low-complexity weighted least squares model can produce much better depth estimation than stateof- the-art methods in terms of average disparity error rate, occlusion boundary precision-recall rate, and the preservation of intricate visual features.
